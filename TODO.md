# TODOs

* add status output (command will be used in cron job that logs to file or sends status email)
* add logging of status to Contao's log (?)
* finally release a first version

* Replace Contao 4.9 "quickfix" (add guzzle to our composer.json like it always should have been)
  with what Contao did: https://github.com/contao/contao/commit/ed6763836e1557a6db35da1674d20759a8b562eb
